## Viewing the SQLite Database

This project uses an SQLite database. To view and manage the database, we recommend using the SQLite Viewer for VSCode. 

### How to Use:
1. Open this project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the recommended extensions when prompted (or manually install the SQLite Viewer from the Extensions Marketplace).
3. After installation, open the database file (`.db`) from the Explorer sidebar, and it will be displayed in the SQLite Viewer tab.
